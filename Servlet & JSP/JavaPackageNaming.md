# Java Package Naming Convention

### 1. com

**Full Form**: Commercial

**Usage**: Used for organizations or entities with a commercial (business) focus. It’s part of the reverse domain naming convention used to avoid conflicts and organize Java packages.

### Example Directory Structure For ***com.acme.corp.utils***:

```bash
your-project/
└── src/
    └── com/
        └── acme/
            └── corp/
                └── utils/
                    └── UtilityClass.java
```

**com**: Indicates a commercial organization.

**acme**: The company or organization name.

**corp**: A division or department within the company.

**utils**: A specific module or utility package.



### 2. in

**Full Form**: India

**Usage**: Used for organizations or entities based in India. It follows the same reverse domain naming convention.


### Example Directory Structure For ***in.example.tech***:


```bash
your-project/
└── src/
    └── in/
        └── example/
            └── tech/
                └── TechClass.java
```


**in**: Indicates an organization based in India.

**example**: The company or organization name.

**tech**: A specific project or module within the company.


This naming convention helps in organizing code and avoiding conflicts by reflecting the domain name in reverse and geographic context.
