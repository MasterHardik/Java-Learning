# ðŸ§ª Software Testing Types â€“ Hierarchical Structure

This hierarchy outlines the different types of software testing, organized by methodology, execution mode, and purpose.

## 1. Based on Code Access

### 1.1 White Box Testing (Structural Testing)
- Unit Testing
- Integration Testing (logic-level)
- Code Coverage Testing (Statement, Branch, Path)

### 1.2 Black Box Testing (Behavioral Testing)
- Functional Testing
- System Testing
- Acceptance Testing

### 1.3 Grey Box Testing
- Combined knowledge of code and UI
- Often used in:
  - Integration Testing
  - Security Testing


## 2. Based on Execution Mode

### 2.1 Manual Testing
- Exploratory Testing
- Ad-hoc Testing
- Usability Testing

### 2.2 Automation Testing
- Regression Testing
- Data-driven Testing
- Keyword-driven Testing


## 3. Based on Test Objective

### 3.1 Functional Testing
- Unit Testing
- Integration Testing
- System Testing
- Sanity Testing
- Smoke Testing
- Regression Testing
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

### 3.2 Non-Functional Testing

#### 3.2.1 Performance Testing
- Load Testing
- Stress Testing
- Scalability Testing
- Stability Testing

#### 3.2.2 Usability Testing

#### 3.2.3 Compatibility Testing

#### 3.2.4 Security Testing

#### 3.2.5 Maintainability Testing


## 4. Based on Integration Approach

### 4.1 Incremental Integration Testing
- Top-Down Integration Testing
- Bottom-Up Integration Testing

### 4.2 Non-Incremental Integration Testing
- Big Bang Integration Testing


## 5. Other Specialized Types

- Alpha Testing
- Beta Testing
- Recovery Testing
- Installation Testing
- Compliance Testing
- Internationalization & Localization Testing
