# Overview of Request Handling in Tomcat

Here's a high-level overview of what happens when a request is made to a web application running on a Tomcat server, including how various components like WEB-INF, ports, WAR files, and servlets come into play:

## Process Flow

### 1. Browser Request
- **Action:** A user enters a URL in their browser or clicks on a link.
- **Description:** The browser initiates an HTTP request to the web server using that URL.

### 2. DNS Resolution
- **Action:** The URL is resolved to an IP address through DNS.
- **Description:** DNS directs the request to the server hosting the web application.

### 3. Network Layer
- **Action:** The request is sent over the network to the server’s IP address.
- **Description:** It reaches the server through a specific port (usually port 80 for HTTP or port 443 for HTTPS).

### 4. Tomcat Server
- **Action:** The request arrives at the Tomcat server.
- **Description:** Tomcat listens for incoming HTTP requests on a specific port (default is 8080). It handles the request and determines which web application should process it.

### 5. Context Mapping
- **Action:** Tomcat uses the context path (derived from the URL) to map the request to a specific web application.
- **Description:** This context path is associated with a particular WAR file.

### 6. WAR File Deployment
- **Action:** The WAR (Web Application Archive) file is deployed.
- **Description:** A WAR file is a packaged collection of files for a web application. It includes compiled classes, libraries, HTML, JSP files, and configuration files. When a WAR file is deployed in Tomcat, it's extracted into a directory structure.

### 7. WEB-INF Directory
- **Action:** Tomcat looks for the WEB-INF directory inside the extracted WAR file.
- **Description:** This directory contains critical configuration and deployment descriptors:
  - `web.xml`: The deployment descriptor file that defines servlets, mappings, and other configuration details.
  - `classes`: Contains compiled Java classes for the servlets and other components.
  - `lib`: Contains JAR files for libraries used by the application.

### 8. Servlet Mapping
- **Action:** Tomcat reads the `web.xml` file within the WEB-INF directory.
- **Description:** It maps the incoming request to a specific servlet based on the URL pattern.

### 9. Servlet Processing
- **Action:** Tomcat creates an instance of the servlet (if it's not already created) and invokes its `service()` method.
- **Description:** The servlet processes the request, possibly interacting with databases or performing business logic.

### 10. Response Sent Back
- **Action:** The servlet’s response is sent back to Tomcat.
- **Description:** Tomcat then sends it over the network to the user's browser.

### 11. Browser Receives Response
- **Action:** The browser receives the HTTP response.
- **Description:** It renders the requested web page or content to the user.

## Detailed Flow

1. **HTTP Request:**
   - User’s browser sends an HTTP request to the Tomcat server. The request includes the URL, method (GET, POST, etc.), and headers.

2. **Tomcat's Request Handling:**
   - Tomcat listens on a port (usually 8080) and receives the request.

3. **Context Path Resolution:**
   - Tomcat resolves the request to a specific web application context. For instance, a URL like `http://example.com/myapp/hello` would map to the `myapp` web application.

4. **WAR File Extraction:**
   - The `myapp` WAR file, deployed in Tomcat's `webapps` directory, is extracted into a directory named `myapp`. Tomcat reads the `WEB-INF` directory within this folder.

5. **Servlet Mapping:**
   - Tomcat processes `web.xml` in the `WEB-INF` directory to find which servlet handles the request. For example, if the URL pattern `/hello` maps to `HelloServlet`, Tomcat forwards the request to `HelloServlet`.

6. **Servlet Execution:**
   - `HelloServlet` processes the request in its `doGet()` or `doPost()` method, depending on the HTTP method used. The servlet generates a response (e.g., HTML).

7. **Response Generation:**
   - The servlet writes to the `HttpServletResponse` object, which Tomcat then sends back to the client’s browser.

8. **Client-side Rendering:**
   - The browser receives the HTTP response, parses it, and displays the content to the user.
